# cycling_to_work

In May 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52708687) that three in five people felt cycling on the road was too dangerous, as cycling was pushed as an alternative to public transport.

Cycling and walking were being backed as alternatives as people who are not able to work from home, were encouraged back to work.

Campaign groups said UK towns and cities must be made cycle-friendly if a change to commuting habits was to succeed.

The latest government survey data before lockdown, however, showed three in five people thought cycling on the road was too dangerous - 61%.

The story used [survey data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/walking-and-cycling-statistics-cw~) from the Department for Transport.
